# Rotate 2D Matrix

## About this project:

Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise:

- Prototype: def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
- Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited in-place.
- You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.

## Tasks To Complete

* [0-rotate_2d_matrix.py](0-rotate_2d_matrix.py) contains a module with a function that rotates an `n` x `n` 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise with the following requirements:
  + Prototype: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`.
  + Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited **in-place**.
  + You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
